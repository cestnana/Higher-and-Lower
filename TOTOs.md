# TODOs for Higher and Lower Game

## Core Game Logic
- [ ] Create a data structure to store items with their rates/values
- [ ] Implement function to randomly select two items for comparison
- [ ] Display choice A and choice B to the user
- [ ] Implement user input for selecting between A and B
- [ ] Compare user's choice with the correct answer (higher rate/value)
- [ ] Provide feedback on whether the user's choice was correct
- [ ] Implement game loop (continue with correct choice becoming new A)
- [ ] Track user's score (consecutive correct answers)

## Basic Features
- [ ] Initialize the game with a set of items and their rates/values
- [ ] Implement game over condition (when user makes an incorrect choice)
- [ ] Display final score at the end of the game

## Error Handling
- [ ] Validate user input (ensure it's a valid choice: A or B)
- [ ] Handle invalid inputs gracefully

## Game Flow
- [ ] Create a game start function
- [ ] Implement a game over function
- [ ] Add option to play again or quit

## Data Management
- [ ] Create a function to load items and their rates from a file or database
- [ ] Ensure there are enough unique items for extended gameplay
